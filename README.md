# APCS Google Classroom Bot
##### This is a repository for a bot that can get links from student submissions on Google Classroom for my AP Computer Science teacher to post student projects on a Markdown file in Github. 
1. The user will log into their Google Account and go through 2-factor authentication if necessary. 
2. Paste in assignment link in the terminal.
3. The program will scrape each student's submission for their project link and add it to "work.md". 
##### Although the bot's abilities are limited at the moment, I hope to add more features to allow all teachers to use Google Classroom more efficiently. 

#### This project was made entirely in Python using the Selenium and Chromedriver libraries.
